          <h2>A co-founder at one of the world's largest communities.</h2>
          <p>
            The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500
            companies has allow me to develop a skillset that helps me in not
            just development, but in every aspect of any bussiness.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's
            largest communities teaching young minds about how to <i>sell</i> yourself
            as a developer and open them to a whole new world of opportunities.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's
            holding you back is yourself.
          </p>
          <p>A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.</p>
          <blockquote>
            "How big would you dream, if you <b>knew</b> you wouldn't fail?"
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            You've already gone through the hardest parts being a developer,
            it's time to elevate your skills and become a leader in something
            you're <i>passionate</i> about.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help your
            company.
